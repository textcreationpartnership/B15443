            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:176731:6"/>and to kindle flames of vprores through the realme, to the vtter wasting of her faithfull subiectes. O that wee had the harts to praise him for it with the like religious affection of spirite in zeale and sincerity, as <hi>Melchisedek</hi> did for <hi>Lot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by <hi>Abram,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; the <hi>Isra√´<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> for the <hi>Egyptian</hi> yoke broken, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> for their safety and the destruction of their enemies. Sure we haue greater causes so to doe, then any of them had. For <hi>Lot</hi> was but one, and that a meane man: nor much indangered more then of losse of libertie. Here a most excellent Princesse was in hazard, not of libertie, but of life: with God knoweth how many righteous <hi>Lots</hi> besides. And the bodily coiles which the <hi>Isra√´lites</hi> endured in <hi>Egypt</hi> vnder the taske-masters that <hi>Pharao</hi> placed ouer them, were nothing in comparison of the spiritual bondage of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, to whom, might these <hi>Egyptian</hi> impes haue had their willes, we should (it is likely) haue beene most lamentably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled.

In these wordes therefore comprehending brieflie the purport and drift of the whole <hi>Psalme</hi> by way of conclusion, two thinges are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to our considerations: one is the benefit of God in deliuering <hi>Dauid</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:176731:7"/>from his enemies; the other, the thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto God for that deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The benefit of God in deliuering <hi>Dauid</hi> is signified by that he saith, <hi>The Lord liueth.</hi> For he meaueth not that <hi>the Lord liueth</hi> in respect of his beeing, his euerlasting essence, in which sense not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 14.15. Reu. 10.6. &amp; 15.7.</note> hee is said to <hi>liue,</hi> and to <hi>liue</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">1. Tim. 6.1.</note>
               <hi>only:</hi> but in respect of his woorkes, his effects to <hi>Dauid</hi> ward, in whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation he sheweth that hee <hi>liueth,</hi> and saueth his, and ruleth all thinges by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal prouidence. Which meaning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> openeth in that he adioyneth, <hi>and my blessed strƒìgth:</hi> calling god his <hi>strength,</hi> his <hi>fortresse,</hi> his <hi>rock,</hi> his <hi>blessed strength</hi> and <hi>foretresse,</hi> because his life, his safetie, his wel-fare is mainteined by the might and mercy of the liuing God. As in
<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 18.2.</note> the beginning he testified also: <hi>The Lord is my rocke, and my fortresse, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerer, my God, my strength in whom I will trust, my shield, &amp; the horne of my saluation, my refuge.</hi> And this is the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of God vnto <hi>Dauid.</hi> The thankfulnes of <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto God foloweth: <hi>Therefore let the God of my saluation be exalted.</hi> Wherein, by the way, the cause of his thankfulnes, to weet, the benefit, is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb facs="tcp:176731:8"/>For though in our toung the name of <hi>saluation</hi> is by common vse referred to the blisseful state of life eternal in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, whereto the scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase doth likewise oft refer it: yet is it applied in
